Make a logo for my app "FavLink" for a responsive website. The app let user manage their favorite links via the Internet. Ask me questions to help you design the logo.

Got it 👍 Let’s make sure the logo for “FavLink” really reflects your app and feels good across devices (desktop + mobile). To design it right, I’ll need some preferences from you first:

Style – Do you prefer a modern and minimal look, a playful and friendly one, or a more professional/corporate vibe?

Colors – Do you have a brand palette already, or should I suggest some (e.g., blue = trust, green = growth, orange = creativity)?

Symbol/Icon – Should the logo include a recognizable symbol (like a link chain, star/favorite icon, or bookmark) or be purely text-based?

Typography – Do you like clean sans-serif fonts (modern) or something more distinctive/stylized?

Usage – Will the logo be used mainly in the website navbar and favicon, or also in apps, print, presentations?

Mood/Message – What do you want users to feel when they see it (e.g., organized, fun, reliable, secure, creative)?

👉 Would you like me to propose a few concept sketches (symbols + color schemes) first, or should I directly generate a ready-to-use logo draft?

You said:
Style = modern and minimal
Colors = growth
Symbol/Icon = ink chain, star
Typography = sans-serif fonts
Usage = website navbar
Mood/Message = organized

Make three options. Create concept sketch. Then when. I approve make the ready-to-use.
